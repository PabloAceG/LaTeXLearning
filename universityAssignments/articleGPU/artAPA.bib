    ABSTRACT=
        "This paper presents a novel scalable algorithm, Gradient Population 
        Optimization (GPO), which is specifically designed to optimize cost 
        functions with extremely high dimensionality. GPO uses the Tensorflow 
        platform, a non-von-Neumann computation model, which implements 
        dataflow graphs on heterogeneous computing hardware (e.g., multi-core 
        central processing unit, graphics processing unit (GPU), and 
        field-programmable gate array) in order to perform massively parallel 
        processing tasks on scalable platforms, such as the cloud. GPO is based
        on the combination of population-based dynamics with gradientbased 
        determinism, in which a coupling term is introduced between the local 
        and global corrections to the positions of population's agents' 
        positions. The GPO exhibited excellent performance in most of the 
        standard benchmark functions that were tested. In particular, GPO 
        demonstrated superb scalability in solving largescale optimization 
        problems using GPU-hardware-accelerated computing platform, positing 
        the algorithm as an effective strategy for real-life massive scale 
        problems, such as machine learning, data mining, and modeling wireless 
        communication systems, such as 5G and massive MIMO.",
