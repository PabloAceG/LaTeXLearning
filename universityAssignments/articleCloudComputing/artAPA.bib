    ABSTRACT="A centralized infrastructure system carries out existing data 
              analytics and decision-making processes from our current highly 
              virtualized platform of wireless networks and the Internet of 
              Things (IoT) applications. There is a high possibility that 
              these existing methods will encounter more challenges and issues 
              in relation to network dynamics, resulting in a high overhead in 
              the network response time, leading to latency and traffic. In 
              order to avoid these problems in the network and achieve an 
              optimum level of resource utilization, a new paradigm called edge 
              computing (EC) is proposed to pave the way for the evolution of 
              new age applications and services. With the integration of EC, the
              processing capabilities are pushed to the edge of network devices 
              such as smart phones, sensor nodes, wearables, and on-board units, 
              where data analytics and knowledge generation are performed which 
              removes the necessity for a centralized system. Many IoT 
              applications,such as smart cities,the smart grid,smart traffic 
              lights,and smart vehicles,are rapidly upgrading their applications
              with EC, significantly improving response time as well as 
              conserving network resources. Irrespective of the fact that EC 
              shifts the workload from a centralized cloud to the edge, the 
              analogy between EC and the cloud pertaining to factors such as 
              resource management and computation optimization are still open to
              research studies. Hence, this paper aims to validate the 
              efficiency and resourcefulness of EC. We extensively survey the 
              edge systems and present a comparative study of cloud computing 
              systems. After analyzing the different network properties in the 
              system, the results show that EC systems perform better than 
              cloud computing systems. Finally, the research challenges in 
              implementing an EC system and future research directions are 
              discussed.",
